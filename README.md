Hi guys! 
This is my first official project. It is several years of collected bookmarks that I have found all over the web and other repositories, friends, anything like that. 
So what you have to do to use these small bits of javascript is but them onto your bookmarks bar.
The file can be easily added to your bookmarks bar by doing Ctrl+O (oh not 0), and then clicking the three dots in the corner.
Now click import, under the three dots.
Now select the file you downloaded from this. 
Some of the names might be misleading. Good luck!
